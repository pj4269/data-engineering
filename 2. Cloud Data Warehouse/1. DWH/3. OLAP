- data is ready for business users. 
- OLAP cubes: data organized in understandable multi dimensions
- Operations on OLAP: 
  1. roll up = sum, aggregation
  2. drill down = decompose (e.g decompose revenue by area)
  3. slicing = where (where month='march')
  4. dicing = where in ['march', 'april']
  5. grouping = group by
  6. CUBE  = GROUP by CUBE (col1, col2) = produces all combinations

OLAP cube technology?

- ROLAP = relational database OLAP =>columnar storage is faster than normal(row) storage!
